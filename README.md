# JQuery Tabs
For week 7 of our forum, we will create an underline animation for `nav` elements using JQuery. 

You will find three files. **index.html** is already complete. It contains standard headers, links to **script.js** and **style.css**, and a simple `nav` element with a list as its child. 

**style.css** is also complete. It has basic styling for the look of the website. 

> Your task is to complete **script.js**. If you missed this week of forum, please look at *Week 7* slides or email [zhong26b@ncssm.edu](mailto:zhong26b@ncssm.edu)
